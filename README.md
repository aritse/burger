### Overview

Eat-Da-Burger is a simple restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Internally, it uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM and follows the MVC design paradigm where Node and MySQL are used to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. This app is currently deployed at https://justburger.herokuapp.com.
